# Module-7-EmployeeDataBaseSQL

## Overview of analysis
The idea of the project was to learn sql and to find the results of the retiring employees, ones that will retire, and titles of employees and the counts. 

## Results
A lot of the older staff are expected to retire soon, leaving a lot of room for new hires but will cause some slow down in production. a way you could help alleviate that issues is to produce a mentor program that can pass on some of that informtion. 

## Summary
To answer the two main questions from the project, how many new employees will be needed as some start to shift into retirement. and are there enough employees to cover the retirees. 

1 - there will be over 70k employees retiring in the future, at the beginning it will be easier to cover, but will become a much harder issue to fix as time goes on. 

2- the seconds comes around that they are very very few employees that are ready for the mentorship program. I Would recommend adjusting that so A LOT more employees can qualify for the program. I think a good approvach to helping with that is to see how you can reduce the size of work force in place some some form of automation if you cant fill the void.
